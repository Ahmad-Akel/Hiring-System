/**
 *The main idea
The personnel agency needs a SW tool for managing its agenda for its effective operation. To this end, it maintains two basic ones
lists (linear list). The first maintains a list of candidates seeking work, the second the individual job positions offered by companies.
Data for these lists can be imported from a CSV file. If a recruitment agency recommends someone for an interview, they register them
in the dynamic field of interviews.
